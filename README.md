### **Part 2: Your Phone Call Script (What to Say Per Slide)**

This script is now perfectly aligned with your final invoice.

**Slide 1-3: Introduction & Framing**
*   **What to Say:** (Same as before) Introduce yourself under the "Roan Tech Solutions" name. Recap the demo and frame the project as a complete 3-part solution (Website, System, Launch Package).

**Slide 4: Clarifying The Scope (The "CRM")**
*   **This remains your most important moment to prevent future problems.**
*   **What to Say:** "Before we discuss the investment, let's quickly confirm the scope of the management system. The plan we've built covers these five core features: Patient Registration, History Notes, the Calendar, M-Pesa/SMS, and the Card System. **To confirm, Doctor, are these the essential features you need for your 'CRM' to get started?**"
*   **Listen carefully.** If he adds complex features (billing, insurance, reports), you must politely state: *"Those are excellent features for a future upgrade. The current 250k plan covers this essential foundation, and we can quote those advanced modules as a Phase 3 project later on."*

**Slide 5: The Total Investment**
*   **What to Say:** "Great. Based on that defined scope, the total investment for the complete, turn-key solution is **KSh 250,000**. As the invoice shows, this breaks down into **80k for the high-quality website**, **150k for the powerful management system**, and **20k for the critical SEO and Google launch package** to ensure you get patients from day one."

**Slide 6: The Milestone Payment Plan**
*   **What to Say:** "To make this manageable and align with our work, we have a simple milestone plan. An initial deposit of **KSh 100,000** to begin, then **KSh 75,000** once the website is fully complete and live, and the final **KSh 75,000** only when the entire management system is finished and ready for your team."

**Slide 7: Aligning on Terms (The Negotiation)**
*   **(He will likely bring up the 5-month cheque plan here).**
*   **Your Script (Be firm, confident, and logical):** "Doctor, I want to be transparent about the payment terms. A 3-month project requires a payment schedule that matches the intense workload. A 5-month plan would mean we couldn't dedicate our resources exclusively to you, and we wouldn't meet your deadline. This milestone structure is the professional standard."
*   "Regarding the payment method, we only work with direct digital payments like bank transfer or M-Pesa. It's secure, instant, and avoids the logistical delays of cheques, which is critical for a fast-moving project like this."

**Slide 8: Next Steps**
*   **What to Say:** "So, to move forward, the next steps are simple. Once we have a verbal agreement on these terms, I will send the finalized invoice for the initial deposit. We can also prepare a formal service agreement for your peace of mind. As soon as the deposit is processed, we will begin work immediately."
*   **Close with a question:** "Does this sound like a fair and clear plan to you?"
